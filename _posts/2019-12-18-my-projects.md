## Cuprune - Self checkout for apparels

Self checkout is omnipresent in retail, but the user experience is still broken as the last piece in the puzzle which is removing the EAS tag which ensures low pilfrage and theft, is something that cannot be removed automatically. 
CuPrune - pronounced as Queue prune, uses a smart detagger which can identiy if the product is sold or not and detag the EAS tags if needed.

## Obhiyo.com - The social marketplace

I love buying books, not sure if I read them fully or not, but have always felt that I buy it at much higer price, but when I sell it back it goes for penny. But the same books that I sold, my friends and college-mates would buy. I had to remove this middle man, hence this website.
